# zero-interest-cc-simulation
A simple web application to calculate the amount of admin fee and installments that you have to pay in 0% interest installments.

Curious about how much you'd pay each month with a 0% interest installment plan? Our easy-to-use calculator does the math for you! Just input the item's price, the number of months you want to spread out payments, and the monthly admin fee (if any). We'll instantly show you:

- Monthly installments for each month
- The remaining balance after each payment
- The total amount you'll pay over time
- How much you'll save compared to the original price

**Why aren't the monthly payments always the same?** Even with 0% interest, you might notice that the monthly amounts can vary slightly. This is because many installment plans include an admin fee, which is often a percentage of the remaining balance. So, while you're not paying interest, the admin fee can make the early payments a bit higher.

Use our calculator to get a clear breakdown of each payment and make informed decisions about your purchases!

**_Important Note: Our calculator assumes that you are only making payments on this specific purchase. If you have other installment plans or loans, your actual monthly payments may differ._**
